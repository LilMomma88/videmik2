I   ve never met one I didn   t like     whether it was in a duck blind or a pheasant field.  ADJUSTABLE GUNS Many guns  mostly semi autos  now come with shims that allow you to alter drop and cast     the stock   s bend to the left A Remington V3 or Versamax would be gentle   39 kickers  39   but a bit beyond your price range unless you can find a used one.
