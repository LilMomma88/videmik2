The masks were annotated by data labelers using CVAT at the same nbsp  The masked output image can be useful for further processing  for example  realtime 3D skeleton tracking  body pose estimation etc.  Like clipping you can use shapes  text or paths to define sections of the mask.  Luckily for you  there   s an actively developed fork of PIL called Pillow     it   s easier to install  runs on all major operating systems  and supports Python 3.  Therefore we use the libraries. XSize band. histogram mask    gt  list.  This library provides extensive file format support  an efficient internal representation  and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.                             Python                                 PIL Python Imaging Library                 Python         PIL 1. py to write the code for training the neural network on our dataset.  The link for installing OpenCV on Ubuntu May 28  2020    Using Python to Access Web Data.  It corresponds to a black image of the same size as the original image.  It is possible to generate a ndarray of the same shape as the image to be processed by np.    pygame.  Functions  . 9. shape  2      Extracting a binary mask image The function  get_mask image   creates a binary mask for a certain ROI instance  that is  a 2D numpy array of the size of the image array  whose elements are  True  if they lie inside the ROI polygon  and  False  otherwise.  You must understand what the code does  not only to run it properly but also to troubleshoot it.  May 17  2020    This series will cover beginner python  intermediate and advanced python  machine learning and later deep learning.  I have the mask showing up as black right now.  The mask simply represent a specific part of the image.  class Add  Layer that adds a list of inputs.  Make a python file train.  are used to succinctly subscribe where to clip images   or to define regions where an image should be transparant.  This will be covered in the next section. python mask image<br><br>
