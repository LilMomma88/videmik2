For linear systems    with non unique solutions  such as under determined systems   the pseudoinverse may be used to construct the solution of minimum Euclidean norm         among all solutions.  It is shown that the structure of the approximate solutions provided by the BJ approach does not depend upon the functional form of the information measure.  Hence we get the unconstrained minimization reformulation min f The minimum norm solution is often considered to be  quot good quot   because if x is some physical signal which you are trying to design  then an x with lower norm often corresponds to a physical signal with lower energy  which then translates to cost savings  etc.  In either case  the minimum norm solution is unique  and it is characterized as being orthogonal to K A   as shown in what follows.  solution set.
