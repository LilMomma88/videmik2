I would suggest you check out the SDK  92 examples  92 peripheral  92 qspi example  since it looks like the W25N01GV supports QSPI.  Please note that the provided files serves as an example   proof of concept.  This will allow the cpu to fetch data directly from the flash.  This chip is newer and different  and although the controls are remarkably similar to the QSPI controller for the Spansion flash on the Basys 3 board  they are different enough to warrant an updated controller.  This driver has been tested on the S7G2 and S3A7 Synergy microcontroller groups using the QSPI peripheral block and the Micron N25Q256A QSPI I am using QSPI not to connect memory  but a FTDI display.  Jump to solution I need to verify the hardware of a prototype board before the revised version is sent to production  and I am having trouble with verifying the QSPI flash  which would absolutely be necessary due to the lack of DDR on the board.  Example.  Aug 08  2020    Flash memory is non volatile  so it retains its values even after the board is powered off.
