The novel feature is the ability of the model to work on datasets with missing values.  The alloc_max_str   function test creates a large string instead of an array  but we should see similar results  def alloc_max_str     quot  quot  quot Allocates memory for maximum string.  I think I missed to paste this step in the original post and hence took Ram   s suggestion.  If dates are available  e.
