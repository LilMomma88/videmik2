The TP9SF is a military grade 9mm striker fired pistol that has successfully passed 60000 round torture tests without any failures while still maintaining NATO standards for accuracy.  Packaged as an ultra affordable option for anyone seeking a reliable self defense pistol  you get the same durability and dependability that made Canik a household name. 19 quot  Barrel  Polymer Frame  Black Finish  Warren Tactical Sights  1 Magazine. warren tactical sights for canik tp9sf<br><br>
