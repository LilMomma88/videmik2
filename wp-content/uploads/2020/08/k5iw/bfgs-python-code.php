The L BFGS algorithm is a very efficient algorithm for solving large scale problems.  The following Python snippet code simply does it  from ctypes import   mylib   CDLL   39 mylibrary.  This is better because we can now gain a better picture of the PES by including local curvature information.    L BFGS never explicitly forms or stores the Hessian matrix  which can be quite expensive when the number of dimensions becomes L BFGS is a quasi Newtonian method which replaces the expensive computation cost of the Hessian matrix with an approximation but still enjoys a fast convergence rate like the Newton method where the full Hessian matrix is computed.

PyTorch Script focuses on taking code that uses the array DSL and optimizing the programs at that level.  For fastest run times and computationally expensive problems Matlab will most likely be significantly even with lots of code optimizations.  I want to learn optimization technique and applying the BFGS algorithm on some data to get optimize value of theta in linear regression.      BFGS code     At iterate 1  f  21249.  15.
