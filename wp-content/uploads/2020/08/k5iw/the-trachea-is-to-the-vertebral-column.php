The trachea is lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium  which is continuous with the larynx.

The vertebral column originally develops as a series of 33 vertebrae  but this number is eventually reduced to 24 vertebrae  plus the sacrum and coccyx.  15 Jul 2020 The vertebral column extends from the skull to the pelvis and consists of 33 vertebrae  which are differentiated into five regions  the cervical nbsp  of the skull and vertebral column and by cerebrospinal fluid  a colorless fluid anterior  ventral  cavity that houses the heart  lungs  esophagus  and trachea.

The is the final segment of the human vertebral column.  Three correspond to the cervical region  12 are in the thoracic region  four are in the lumbar region  and four correspond to the sacral region.  Many vertebral levels are associated with key anatomical landmarks.  The esophagus  which conducts swallowed materials to the stomach  is normally flattened.  This results in displacement of the trachea and carina to the right and posteriorly.  There are typically 23 ganglia in the chain on either side of the spinal column.  e.  The trachea normally diverges away from the vertebral column on the lateral radiograph.  The posterior scalene   Latin  scalenus posterior  is the smallest and most deeply seated of the scalene muscles.  In such cases  since the portion of the aorta derived from the bulbus arteriosus is directed upward and to the right and the descending aorta is lying to the left side of the vertebral column  a right arch passes from right to left behind the trachea and esophagus.
