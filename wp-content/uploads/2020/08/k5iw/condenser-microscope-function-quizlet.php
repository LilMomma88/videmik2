An alternative microscope is the dark   field microscope  which is used to observe live spirochetes  such as those that cause syphilis.  The design of the dark field microscope is such that it removes the dispersed light  or zeroth order  so that only the scattered beams hit the sample.  The microscope condenser images the annular diaphragm at infinity  while the objective produces an image at the rear focal plane  where a conjugate phase plate is positioned  as discussed below .  The first light microscope was made by Janssen and Hans in 1590.  The major difference is that light microscopes use light rays to focus and produce an image while the TEM uses a beam of electrons to focus on the specimen  to produce an image.
