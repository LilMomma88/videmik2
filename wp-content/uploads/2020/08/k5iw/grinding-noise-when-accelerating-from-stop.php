Re  1994 850 Grinding noise with accelerating from stop Post by daversm    09 Sep 2014  01 31 I too thought it was the fender skirt  but the noise is there when the car is in park also.  Grinding on front passenger side when accelerating from stop I own a 2004 PT Cruiser  and when I accelerate from a stop  and mainly when I  39 m making a right turn from a stop   I will hear a grinding noise for a second.  It sounds like the grinding is coming from front driver side and now also the front passenger side wheel wells simultaneously.  When your brakes are making a loud grinding sound when you press on the pedal  this is almost always caused by contact of the rotor disc with part of the caliper.  It doesn  39 t happen in any other gears when I step on the gas and it doesn  39 t happen when I accelerate gently from a complete stop. grinding noise when accelerating from stop<br><br>
