After that  the process of classification was simply deciding which side of the vector that any given sample was on.  For each sample we also have a species label.  Hence  if there are categorical attributes  we rst have to convert them into numeric data.  It is primarily written for sparse datasets  number of non zero features in an example is typically small .  The other classifier  SVM is one of the prominent classifiers that can work in high dimensional data and able to used kernel function to map the real data into a higher dimension.  Aug 28  2018    A Support Vector Machine  SVM  is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. but unable to install it.  Because code generation does not support categorical predictors  use dummyvar to convert categorical predictors to numeric dummy variables before fitting an SVM classifier.  If you have Statistics Toolbox and MATLAB 9a or later  you can use TreeBagger.  Before moving on  it   s worth pointing out that SVMs are among the most powerful machine learning algorithms for classification tasks and are used extensively for applications ranging from computer vision to NLP.
