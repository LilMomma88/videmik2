Each bunch of threads inside those chain loops represents one inch of warp.  With a floor loom  you have two options for warping  use a board  or mill  and a raddle  or  opt for a sectional warp beam which allows you to warp by yourself  one section at at time  but you then will need other tools such as a tension box  yarn counter  bobbin rack and spools.
