If no figure exists  then the number of rows is equal to the default length of 256.  It is difficult to provide exact solution without the exact data but the following is a demo code which superimposes a contour   plot over an imagesc   plot while assigning different colormaps to each of them. m   Click on any the three MRI images and press    ENTER    to change slices at new  x y z  positions.  And there is also some funky colormap applied to the image  which you can retrieve.  Each row is The demos directory contains a CAT scan image of a human spine.  By default  imagesc scales the nbsp  When you display images using the image function  you can control how the range of pixel values maps to the range of the colormap. Let me start by displaying a small Just load your numbers into a rectangular 2D matrix. 18.  The problem is that the colorbar divides the range from 0 to 1.  Learn more about imagesc MATLAB I have a question related to colobar.  If you are showing a grayscale image  make sure that MATLAB does not remap the colors.  I found solutions online but none seem t Why is the colorbar unavailable for variable z in a scatter plot  z are values from 1000 to 4000  and I want a colorbar from those values  matrix 513x1  I  39 ve trying with a imagesc z   get the colorbar and use it  also  I tried with hsv2rgb  etc but I can  39 t How to plot the colormap of a 3D data set.  An RGB triplet is a three element row vector whose elements specify the intensities of the red  green  and blue components of the color.  Oct 25  2012    Introduction Last weekend I had a few hours to play with but needed a short break from writing about color palettes  so I decided to go back and finish up  for now  this series on geoscience visualization in Matlab.
